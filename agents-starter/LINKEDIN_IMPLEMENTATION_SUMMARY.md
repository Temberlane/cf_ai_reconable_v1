});
```

### Detailed Profile Analysis
```typescript
const profile = await analyzeLinkedInProfile({
  profileUrl: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnsmith",
  includeConnections: true,
  includePosts: true
});
```

### Company Research
```typescript
const company = await researchLinkedInCompany({
  companyName: "Acme Corporation",
  includeEmployees: true
});
```

### Network Analysis
```typescript
const network = await analyzeLinkedInNetwork({
  profileUrl: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnsmith",
  maxConnections: 100,
  includeMutualConnections: true
});
```

## Integration with Agents

The LinkedIn OSINT tools are fully integrated with the Cloudflare Agents framework:

- **Tool Registration**: All tools are registered in the main tools export
- **Execution Functions**: Implemented in the executions object for human confirmation
- **Agent Context**: Access to agent environment and state
- **Error Handling**: Integrated with agent error handling system
