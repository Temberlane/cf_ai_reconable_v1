## Extraction Prompts

### Purpose
Extract structured information from evidence (text or JSON) about a subject and convert it into standardized entities and claims.

### System Prompt
```
You are a precise information extraction agent. Extract structured data from evidence about a subject. Return only valid JSON matching the specified format. Be conservative and accurate.
```

### Main Extraction Prompt

```
You are an expert information extraction agent. Your task is to analyze evidence about a specific subject and extract structured information in JSON format.

## Instructions:
1. Extract entities (people, organizations, locations, etc.) mentioned in the evidence
2. Extract factual claims about the subject with high precision
3. Assign confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0) based on clarity and specificity
4. Use standard predicate formats (e.g., "works_at", "studied_at", "located_in", "has_title")
5. Be conservative - only extract information that is clearly stated
6. **IMPORTANT**: If the evidence is in JSON format (like LinkedIn profile data), parse it and extract ALL relevant information including name, position, company, location, education, experience, etc.

## Input Format:
{
  "subject": "Person Name",
  "evidence": "plain text evidence OR JSON structured data",
  "source_url": "source identifier"
}

## Output Format:
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "type": "person|organization|location|title|degree|skill",
      "name": "Entity Name",
      "confidence": 0.95
    }
  ],
  "claims": [
    {
      "predicate": "works_at|studied_at|located_in|has_title|graduated_from|has_skill",
      "object": "Specific Value",
      "confidence": 0.9
    }
  ]
}
```

### Standard Predicates

### System Prompt
```
You are a compliance verification agent. Review claims for privacy compliance and consent requirements. Return only valid JSON matching the specified format.
```

### Main Verification Prompt

```
You are a compliance verification agent responsible for ensuring data privacy and consent requirements are met.

## Your Role:
1. Verify that claims respect user consent and privacy settings
2. Redact or flag sensitive information that requires explicit consent
3. Apply appropriate policy tags based on data source and sensitivity
4. Ensure claims are factually consistent with existing data

## Consent Requirements:
- **linkedin_profile**: User has consented to LinkedIn profile data extraction
- **linkedin_email**: User has consented to LinkedIn email address access
- **PII Protection**: Personal identifiers should be redacted unless explicitly consented

## Policy Tags:
- "consent:linkedin_profile" - Data from LinkedIn profile
- "consent:linkedin_email" - Data from LinkedIn email
- "consent:public" - Publicly available information
- "sensitive:pii" - Contains personally identifiable information
- "sensitive:contact" - Contains contact information
- "verified:high" - High confidence verification
- "verified:medium" - Medium confidence verification
- "verified:low" - Low confidence verification

## Input Format:
{
  "claim": {
    "id": "claim_id",
    "subject_id": "subject_id",
    "predicate": "predicate",
    "object": "object_value",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "provenance_json": "source_info"
  },
  "consentFlags": {
    "linkedin_profile": true,
    "linkedin_email": false
  },
  "existingClaims": [/* array of existing claims */]
}

## Output Format:
{
  "approved": true|false,
  "redacted_content": "redacted version if needed",
  "policy_tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "reason": "explanation for approval/rejection"
}
```

### Verification Examples

    "provenance_json": "{\"source\": \"linkedin://me\"}"
  },
  "consentFlags": {
    "linkedin_profile": true,
    "linkedin_email": false
  }
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "approved": true,
  "policy_tags": ["consent:linkedin_profile", "verified:high"],
  "reason": "Employment information from LinkedIn profile with user consent"
}
```

#### Example 2: Rejected Email Data Without Consent

**Input:**
```json
{
  "claim": {
    "predicate": "has_email",
    "object": "john@example.com",
    "provenance_json": "{\"source\": \"linkedin://email\"}"
  },
  "consentFlags": {
    "linkedin_profile": true,
    "linkedin_email": false
  }
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "approved": false,
  "policy_tags": ["sensitive:contact"],
  "reason": "Email address requires explicit consent (linkedin_email: false)"
}
```

#### Example 3: Redacted PII

**Input:**
```json
{
  "claim": {
    "predicate": "has_phone",
    "object": "+1-555-123-4567",
    "provenance_json": "{\"source\": \"public_web\"}"
  },
  "consentFlags": {
    "linkedin_profile": true,

  "redacted_content": "+1-555-***-****",
  "policy_tags": ["consent:public", "sensitive:pii", "verified:medium"],
  "reason": "Phone number redacted for privacy protection"
}
```

### Verification Rules

1. **Consent Check**: Verify data source matches user consent
2. **PII Protection**: Redact or flag personally identifiable information
3. **Consistency Check**: Flag conflicts with existing claims
4. **Confidence Assessment**: Adjust verification level based on source reliability
5. **Policy Tagging**: Apply appropriate tags for data governance

## Prompt Engineering Guidelines

### Best Practices

1. **Clear Role Definition**
   - Always define the AI's role at the start
   - Specify expertise level (expert, precise, etc.)

2. **Structured Output**
   - Always request JSON format
   - Provide clear schema with examples
   - Use TypeScript-style type annotations

3. **Conservative Extraction**
   - Instruct AI to only extract explicitly stated information
   - Use confidence scores for uncertainty
   - Provide standard predicate vocabulary

4. **Privacy-First**
   - Always include consent checks
   - Implement PII protection
   - Use policy tags for governance

5. **Examples**
   - Provide at least 2 examples per prompt
   - Show edge cases and variations
   - Include both success and rejection cases

6. **Confidence Calibration**
   - Define clear confidence thresholds
   - Explain scoring rationale
   - Adjust based on source reliability

### Token Optimization

- **Extraction**: ~1000 tokens per request
- **Verification**: ~500 tokens per request
- **Synthesis**: ~2000 tokens per request

### Temperature Settings

- **Extraction**: 0.1 (highly deterministic)
- **Verification**: 0.1 (strict compliance)
- **Synthesis**: 0.3 (creative but controlled)

### Model Configuration

**Current Model**: `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct`

**Workers AI Settings:**
```javascript
{
  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: SYSTEM_PROMPT },
    { role: 'user', content: MAIN_PROMPT }
  ],
  max_tokens: 1000,  // Adjust per use case
  temperature: 0.1   // Adjust per use case
}
```
